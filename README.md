Overview
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of movie sales data to understand factors that impact box office success. Using real-world datasets, we uncover trends in gross revenue, budgets, genres, ratings, and more. Our goal is to deliver actionable insights for filmmakers, studios, and investors to recognize what drives commercial performance in the film industry.

Data Sources:

Financial metrics (production budget, domestic and worldwide gross revenue)

User and critic ratings (IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic)

Additional features (runtime, studio, release month/season)

(Specify your actual CSV/JSON or database source here if needed.)

Key Questions Explored:
What genres and production strategies consistently achieve blockbuster sales?

How do budgets and ratings correlate with commercial performance?

How have trends in movie sales evolved over time?

What influence do cast, director, and studio have on gross and critical success?

Methodology:
Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, type conversion, normalization)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with descriptive statistics

Visualization using Python libraries (matplotlib, seaborn) and/or Power BI

Correlation and trend analysis (comparisons by year, genre, budget quartile)

Insights and recommendations for movie industry stakeholders
